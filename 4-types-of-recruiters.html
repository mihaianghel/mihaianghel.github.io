                </a>The 4 types of recruiters
            </h1>

            <p>Nowadays the internet is the fastest and easiest way to get in touch with people for different reasons.
                The email replaced the plain old handwritten letter and the IM group chats replaced the pleasant gatherings
                with friends. And then the social media appeared on the scene ... . Multi-purpose networks have developed,
                mixing concerns and putting people in contact with more people. Everyone is a friend of everyone, proving
                an old saying that "a friend to all is a friend to none". But this is another topic. One of these networks
                is LinkedIn which has been hijacked by this guild of individuals engaged in hunting professionals in order
                to reach a target and get their slice of the pie. They are the recruiters, and I have identified 4 types.
