            <br>

            <p>Nowadays the internet is the fastest and easiest way to get in touch with people for different reasons.
                The email replaced the plain old handwritten letter and the IM group chats replaced the pleasant gatherings
                with friends. And then the social media appeared on the scene ... . Multi-purpose networks have developed,
                mixing concerns and putting people in contact with more people. Everyone is a friend of everyone, proving
                an old saying that "a friend to all is a friend to none". But this is another topic. One of these networks
                is LinkedIn which has been hijacked by this guild of individuals engaged in hunting people in order to reach
                a target and get their slice of the pie. They are the recruiters, and I have identified five different species
                based on their strategy of approaching people.

            <p>This guys adopts a humble attitude and tells you how sorry he is for disturbing you. Also, he emphasises
                that this might not be the best way to approach you but "desperate times require desperate measures". He
                starts his message like this:
                <blockquote>
                Hello,
                <br>
                I hope you don't mind my informal and direct message, I know this is not the best way to approach people
                but let's get straight to business.
                <br>
                I am currently working with the world's biggest ...
                </blockquote>
                Ok cowboy, we both now what you are after and you don't really care.
            </p>

            <h3>
                <a id="bison" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true">
                    <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
                </a>Bison
            </h3>
            <p>The bison is the type that doesn't really care about your profile. Not so aggressive as his African cousin -
                the buffalo, described below - he is very relaxed and sends emails to all his contacts. Probably even his grandma received 
                a job spec for a Python developer in Shoreditch. Sometimes you might wonder if he has ever seen your LinkedIn
                profile. The last email I received from a bison was for a DevOps engineer in Manchester. Not even close ...
            </p>

            <h3>
                <a id="buffalo" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true">
                    <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
                </a>Buffalo
            </h3>
            <p>In his madness, the roles are reversed. He thinks that the candidates are chasing the recruiters not the other way around.
                He has a sense of aggressiveness and his motto is "less is better". His emails are very concise:
                <blockquote>
                    Hi,
                    <br>
                    I have a Java developer role. Give me a call if you are interested.
                </blockquote>
            
                or

                <blockquote>
                    Hi,
                    <br>
                    Thanks for connecting with me. Let me know if I can help you.
                </blockquote>
            
                If I think twice, my dogs should see the vet and my car needs a wash. Can you help me with that ?
            </p>

                </a>Cougar
            </h3>
            <p>He is a laid-back kind of guy who doesn't bother too much about the candidates. Probably he doesn't care too
                much about his clients either. He offers you the opportunity of reading someone else's mailbox.
                <blockquote>
                    Hi Mohamed,
                    <br>
                    Could you please forward to me you most recent CV to my email.
                    Best regards
                </blockquote>
            
            Oops, my name is not even Mohamed. Dismissed!

                </a>Hyena
            </h3>
            <p>The hyena is ruthless. He calls you straight on your work number or sends emails to your work inbox. "I just 
                joined the company two months ago ! How did he get my phone number ?!". Or even worse, he knows what is going to
                happen in your company. Check this out :

                <blockquote>
                    Hi,
                    <br>
                    I am aware that <i>company_X</i> have invested heavily in their new office in <i>country_Y</i>, and as a 
                    result of that the politics in the London office have changed heavily. I also know there is an announcement
                    due to come out this week which could result in a number of people being let go, I already know that several
                    projects have been shut down. If you are going to be affected by this or just tired of the changes at 
                    <i>company_X</i> please let me know.
                </blockquote>
            
                This guy is a visionary! I just hit the jackpot!
            </p>

            <p>At the end of the day, the recruiters are a necessary evil that is part of the business and cannot be avoided
                and we all need to deal with it. Preferably as little as possible.
            </p>

            <p>Happy hunting!</p>
